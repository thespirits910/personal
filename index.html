      Future Full Stack Engineer
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a passionate software engineer with a global perspective, having lived in Iraq, Malaysia, Syria, Dubai, and
      Qatar before settling in the U.S. My diverse upbringing has shaped my problem-solving skills, allowing me to
      approach challenges with creativity and adaptability. I speak Arabic, English, Malay, and am currently learning
      Spanish, giving me the ability to connect with diverse cultures and markets.<br>

      Initially aspiring to be a doctor, I discovered my true passion for technology and decided to pursue a career in
      software engineering. I am dedicated to building innovative solutions that improve everyday life, with the
      ultimate goal of developing an app that will be widely used. I thrive on learning new technologies, optimizing
      systems, and creating software that balances functionality with intuitive user experiences.
