        The first project is related to develop a single Web page using only
        two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in creating a
        single web page with a menu at the top know as Navigation Bar. We have
        to include text describing ourself and text describing the project.
        Additionally, we need to include two images: one image is of ourself
        and second image is anything related to the project itself.

      <h3>Project 2</h3>
      <p>
        I developed a Dice Number Generator application that simulates rolling a dice, generating random numbers between
        1 and 6. The project was built using [insert programming language], utilizing built-in randomization functions
        to ensure that each roll is unpredictable and simulates a real-life dice experience. The application has a
        simple, user-friendly interface that allows users to generate multiple rolls and view the results instantly.
        This project helped reinforce my understanding of randomization algorithms, UI/UX design, and basic event
        handling. It also laid the groundwork for future projects that incorporate randomness and gaming logic.

      <p>
        I created a Magic 8-Ball application that mimics the classic fortune-telling toy. The project was developed
        using [insert programming language], allowing users to ask a question and receive a randomized answer from a set
        of 20 pre-defined responses (e.g., "Yes," "No," "Ask again later"). The app features a clean, intuitive
        interface where users can shake or click the virtual 8-ball for their answer. This project enhanced my skills in
        randomization, UI development, and integrating event-driven logic. It also gave me a deeper understanding of how
        to create interactive and playful user experiences.
